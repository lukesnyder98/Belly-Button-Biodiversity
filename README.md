# Belly Button Biodiversity
 
In this project, we created a "Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard" to present results from a study on bacteria living in human belly buttons. We used JavaScript and Plotly to loop through a JSON file of the data, linked the scripts to the HTML, and finally used CSS to customize the page. The user can select subject IDs from the dropdown menu to view each individual subject's data.

The dashboard can be found at https://lukesnywalker.github.io/Belly-Button-Biodiversity/.
